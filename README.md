## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass


### What I learned

- Implementing Sass and nesting child elements within the parent elements. 
- I got a better understandin of how to use sass and the many possibilities it offers, like reducing the amount of code. 


### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on learning sass in depth, and applying media queries using mixins, @use and @import.
